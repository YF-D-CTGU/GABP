This data is used to train the GA-BP model, after the training is completed, GA-BP can be used to carry out the multi-objective function of the  reinforced soil embankment with wrapped face optimization (the first six columns in the training set are the input values, and the last five columns are the output values), and the result of the optimization is the Pareto solution set, which is the solution set to select the appropriate the reinforced soil embankment with wrapped face design scheme.
